# Pipe-Game
C++ Pipe Game uses SFML graphics

Debug/compile and run instructions:
All the configurations for this project is in the main cmake file.
All you have to do is to have SFML 2.5.1 version downloaded and located in
C directory (on windows) because that is where the cmake directs it
to find it.
You can download SFML from https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1
while you have it you can open it in wisual studio - in which I wrote it, or any 
other code editor and debug/run as you wish.
